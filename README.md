To create a blog post add a file in your respective directory with the following format:
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```
Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:
```
2021-03-24-gnome-40-release.md
2019-09-12-a-new-look-for-the-health-app.md

    - [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#installation) (if not installed by your package manager)
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Installing Dependencies in **Ubuntu/Debian**
  ```bash
  # update repositories & install basic build dependencies
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential bash git rsync curl gnupg2

  # prepare to install nodejs and yarn
  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
  curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg >/dev/null

  # add yarn package to whitelist
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/yarnkey.gpg] https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

  # update repositories & install nodejs, yarn and rbenv
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install rbenv nodejs yarn ruby-build

  # initialize rbenv
  rbenv init

  # updates ruby-build local packages
  git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build

  # install ruby 2.7.5
  rbenv install 2.7.5
  ```
- Installing Dependencies Windows
  - Please use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
- Installing Dependencies in macOS
  ```bash
  # install dependencies
  brew install node@16 rsync gnupg2 openssl rbenv ruby-build

  # force system to use node.js v16
  brew link --force --overwrite node@16

  # install ruby 2.7.5
  rbenv install 2.7.5
  ```
- Installing Dependencies Docker
  - Haha, that's a joke. Docker is the only real dependency!
  - Optionally [install `docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)
    (if on Linux)

### Setting up the repository

To get the site up and running locally, follow the below steps:

**PS.:** You need to have a full Bash environment. If you're on Windows, please use WSL.

- Create a local clone of the website:
  ```
  git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Engagement/websites/people-of-gnome.git
  ```
- Change into the people-of-gnome directory
  ```
  cd people-of-gnome
  ```
### Setup and serve locally

#### In host OS

- Perform the following commands to install dependencies and structure the website properly:
  ```
  ./setup.sh
  ```
- Build the site and make it available on your local server
  ```
  ./run.sh
  ```

### In Docker

- If `docker compose` is installed _(default on MacOS and Windows)_
```bash
docker compose up

### personal customisation options in docker-compose.override.yml
### https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files

```
- Using just `docker`
```bash
docker build --tag people-of-gnome:dev .
docker run -it \
    --name=people-of-gnome-dev-server \
    --volume=$(pwd):/site \
    --volume=/site/node_modules \
    --volume=/site/.bundle \
    --volume=/site/assets/3rd-party \
    --publish=4000:4000 \
    --publish=35729:35729 \
    people-of-gnome:dev

### customisation options `man docker-run`
```

- Browse [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the website.

## Pipeline

The pipeline used by the website is the top-level component of continuous
integration, delivery, and deployment.

The pipeline defined by this repository uses the `Ruby2.5` image. The pipeline
consists of a script that runs before the site is tested/deployed. The
script that runs before the test/deployment of the website basically
installs all the `gem/npm dependencies` and then builds the website
before testing/deploying.

`test` stage is performed on all branches but `master`. `deploy` stage on
the other hand is performed only on `master` branch.
